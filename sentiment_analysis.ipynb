        "What is sentiment analysis, exactly? What are we actually measuring with VADER?\n",
        "\n",
        "These are tough and important questions. According to VADER's creators, C.J. Hutto and Eric Gilbert, \"Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, is an active area of study in the field of natural language processing that analyzes people's **opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions** via the computational treatment of subjectivity in text\" ([\"VADER\"](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122)).\n",
        "\n",
        "I would like to emphasize that \"opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions\" covers a *lot* of ground. These are complex categories of human experience that can be expressed in many different ways, especially in different contexts. In fact, that's why Hutto and Gilbert designed VADER specifically for *social media* texts, because sentiment gets expressed differently in social media posts than in, say, fictional stories or newspaper articles.\n",
        "\n",
        "We want to remain critical and self-reflexive about what exactly we are measuring with VADER ‚Äî¬†especially when we apply VADER to non-social media texts, as we will with \"Little Red-Cap\" below. Too often I have encountered well-meaning students who want to understand complex social or textual phenomena (e.g., mental health, a reader's emotional experience of a story, opinions about climate change) by reducing it only to sentiment analysis scores, without doing more and without thinking more deeply about whether those scores actually capture what they're interested in.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, yes, tools like VADER can be useful, as we will see below, but they are only useful when thoughtfully and deliberately applied."

        "\n",
        "VADER, which stands for **V**alence **A**ware **D**ictionary and s**E**ntiment **R**easoner, calculates the sentiment of texts by referring to a lexicon of words that have been assigned sentiment scores as well as by using a handful of simple rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can read more about how VADER was designed in [C.J. Hutto and Eric Gilbert's published paper](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122), but here's a summary version: VADER's lexicon was created by enlisting 10 different people to rate thousands of words positively or negatively on a scale of -4 to 4 (you can scroll through the [lexicon on GitHub](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/master/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt) and check it out for yourself ‚Äî each line consists of a word, the mean rating, standard deviation, and 10 individual human ratings).\n",

        "\n",
        "*This figure shows the interface presented to the 10 raters for rating the sentiment of words. It is taken from [\"VADER: A Parsimonious Rule-based Model for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Text.\"](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122)*\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, you can see that the acronym [ROFL](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L368) (Rolling on the Floor Laughing) has a mean rating of 2.7, the word [*crappy*](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L1622) has a mean rating of -2.5, and the word [*bliss*](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L1127) has a mean rating of 2.7. If you look at the 10 individual ratings for each entry, however, you can see interesting discrepancies. One person rated *bliss* as a 4, while another person rated *bliss* as a 1. Just how \"positive\" is the word *bliss*? What do *you* think?\n",
        "\n",
        "What about [*cutesie*](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L1721)? It has a mean rating of 1, but two people rated it as a -1, and five people rated as a 2. Is *cutesie* an admiring adjective ‚Äî \"[She was so cutesie I just had to talk to her](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cutesie)\" ‚Äî or a diminutive slight ‚Äî \"Ugh, her apartment was too cutesie\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "These difficult questions come up repeatedly when you read through the lexicon. Of course, VADER is designed to generalize beyond individual responses and interpretations, and it is not expected to capture the nuances of every single text. At the same time, whenever we use sentiment analysis tools, we want to ask: Does it matter that we're missing out on specific nuances? Is this the best tool for capturing what we're trying to study and understand?\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to its lexicon, VADER also calculates sentiment by considering 5 relatively simple rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "> 1. If there's punctuation, especially exclamation points, the sentiment intensity should be increased (e.g., \"Mochi ice cream is bliss\" üëç vs \"Mochi ice cream is bliss!!!\" üëçüëçüëç )\n",
        "\n",
        "> 2. If there's capitalization, especially all caps, the sentiment intensity should be increased (e.g., \"Mochi ice cream is bliss\" üëç vs \"Mochi ice cream is BLISS\" üëçüëçüëç )\n",
        "\n",
        "> 3. If there are words like \"extremely\" or \"absolutely\", the sentiment should be increased (\"Mochi ice cream is good\" üëç  vs \"Mochi ice cream is extremely good\" üëçüëçüëç )\n",
        "\n",
        "> 4. If there's a \"but\" in a sentence, the polarity of the sentiment should shift, and the sentiment that follows the \"but\" should be prioritized (e.g., \"Mochi ice cream is nice\" üëç vs \"Mochi ice cream is nice, but it's a little blah\" üëé )\n",
        "\n",
        "> 5. If there's a negation before an important word, the sentiment polarity should be flipped (\"Mochi ice cream is my favorite\" üëç vs \"Mochi ice cream is not my favorite\" üëé )\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Because VADER uses this lexicon and these simple rules, it works very fast and doesn't require any training or set up, unlike more sophisticated machine learning approaches. The simplicity is both its pro and con."
