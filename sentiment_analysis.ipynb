        "What is sentiment analysis, exactly? What are we actually measuring with VADER?\n",
        "\n",
        "These are tough and important questions. According to VADER's creators, C.J. Hutto and Eric Gilbert, \"Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, is an active area of study in the field of natural language processing that analyzes people's **opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions** via the computational treatment of subjectivity in text\" ([\"VADER\"](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122)).\n",
        "\n",
        "I would like to emphasize that \"opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions\" covers a *lot* of ground. These are complex categories of human experience that can be expressed in many different ways, especially in different contexts. In fact, that's why Hutto and Gilbert designed VADER specifically for *social media* texts, because sentiment gets expressed differently in social media posts than in, say, fictional stories or newspaper articles.\n",
        "\n",
        "We want to remain critical and self-reflexive about what exactly we are measuring with VADER ‚Äî¬†especially when we apply VADER to non-social media texts, as we will with \"Little Red-Cap\" below. Too often I have encountered well-meaning students who want to understand complex social or textual phenomena (e.g., mental health, a reader's emotional experience of a story, opinions about climate change) by reducing it only to sentiment analysis scores, without doing more and without thinking more deeply about whether those scores actually capture what they're interested in.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, yes, tools like VADER can be useful, as we will see below, but they are only useful when thoughtfully and deliberately applied."

        "\n",
        "VADER, which stands for **V**alence **A**ware **D**ictionary and s**E**ntiment **R**easoner, calculates the sentiment of texts by referring to a lexicon of words that have been assigned sentiment scores as well as by using a handful of simple rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can read more about how VADER was designed in [C.J. Hutto and Eric Gilbert's published paper](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122), but here's a summary version: VADER's lexicon was created by enlisting 10 different people to rate thousands of words positively or negatively on a scale of -4 to 4 (you can scroll through the [lexicon on GitHub](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/master/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt) and check it out for yourself ‚Äî each line consists of a word, the mean rating, standard deviation, and 10 individual human ratings).\n",

        "[![](../images/VADER-fig.png)](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122)\n",
        "\n",
        "*This figure shows the interface presented to the 10 raters for rating the sentiment of words. It is taken from [\"VADER: A Parsimonious Rule-based Model for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Text.\"](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122)*\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, you can see that the acronym [ROFL](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L368) (Rolling on the Floor Laughing) has a mean rating of 2.7, the word [*crappy*](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L1622) has a mean rating of -2.5, and the word [*bliss*](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L1127) has a mean rating of 2.7. If you look at the 10 individual ratings for each entry, however, you can see interesting discrepancies. One person rated *bliss* as a 4, while another person rated *bliss* as a 1. Just how \"positive\" is the word *bliss*? What do *you* think?\n",
        "\n",
        "What about [*cutesie*](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L1721)? It has a mean rating of 1, but two people rated it as a -1, and five people rated as a 2. Is *cutesie* an admiring adjective ‚Äî \"[She was so cutesie I just had to talk to her](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cutesie)\" ‚Äî or a diminutive slight ‚Äî \"Ugh, her apartment was too cutesie\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "These difficult questions come up repeatedly when you read through the lexicon. Of course, VADER is designed to generalize beyond individual responses and interpretations, and it is not expected to capture the nuances of every single text. At the same time, whenever we use sentiment analysis tools, we want to ask: Does it matter that we're missing out on specific nuances? Is this the best tool for capturing what we're trying to study and understand?\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to its lexicon, VADER also calculates sentiment by considering 5 relatively simple rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "> 1. If there's punctuation, especially exclamation points, the sentiment intensity should be increased (e.g., \"Mochi ice cream is bliss\" üëç vs \"Mochi ice cream is bliss!!!\" üëçüëçüëç )\n",
        "\n",
        "> 2. If there's capitalization, especially all caps, the sentiment intensity should be increased (e.g., \"Mochi ice cream is bliss\" üëç vs \"Mochi ice cream is BLISS\" üëçüëçüëç )\n",
        "\n",
        "> 3. If there are words like \"extremely\" or \"absolutely\", the sentiment should be increased (\"Mochi ice cream is good\" üëç  vs \"Mochi ice cream is extremely good\" üëçüëçüëç )\n",
        "\n",
        "> 4. If there's a \"but\" in a sentence, the polarity of the sentiment should shift, and the sentiment that follows the \"but\" should be prioritized (e.g., \"Mochi ice cream is nice\" üëç vs \"Mochi ice cream is nice, but it's a little blah\" üëé )\n",
        "\n",
        "> 5. If there's a negation before an important word, the sentiment polarity should be flipped (\"Mochi ice cream is my favorite\" üëç vs \"Mochi ice cream is not my favorite\" üëé )\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Because VADER uses this lexicon and these simple rules, it works very fast and doesn't require any training or set up, unlike more sophisticated machine learning approaches. The simplicity is both its pro and con."

            "Congratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history, Mitch McConnell.\n",
            "And congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority Leader, this time with an even bigger majority.\n",
            "And I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country, Nancy Pelosi.\n",
            "The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.\n",
            "A story that is unique among all nations.\n",
            "We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it.\n",
            "That is what we are doing again.\n",
            "Two years ago, our economy was reeling.\n",
            "As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.\n",
            "Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.\n",
            "Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.\n",
            "And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.\n",
            "Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.\n",
            "As we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities.\n",
            "You know, we‚Äôre often told that Democrats and Republicans can‚Äôt work together.\n",
            "But over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong.\n",
            "Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to go it alone.\n",
            "But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.\n",
            "Came together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.\n",
            "Came together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building bridges to connect our nation and people.\n",
            "Came together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.\n",
            "In fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love.\n",
            "To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can‚Äôt work together in this new Congress.\n",
            "The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.\n",
            "And that‚Äôs always been my vision for our country.\n",
            "To restore the soul of the nation.\n",
            "To rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class.\n",
            "To unite the country.\n",
            "We‚Äôve been sent here to finish the job.\n",
            "For decades, the middle class was hollowed out.\n",
            "Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down.\n",
            "Once-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.\n",
            "And along the way, something else was lost.\n",
            "Pride. That sense of self-worth.\n",
            "I ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.\n",
            "To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.\n",
            "As my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It‚Äôs about your dignity. It‚Äôs about respect. It‚Äôs about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‚ÄúHoney ‚Äìit‚Äôs going to be OK,‚Äù and mean it.\n",
            "So, let‚Äôs look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.\n",
            "We‚Äôve already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years.\n",
            "Where is it written that America can‚Äôt lead the world in manufacturing again?\n",
            "For too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs.\n",
            "Now, thanks to all we‚Äôve done, we‚Äôre exporting American products and creating American jobs.\n",
            "Inflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin‚Äôs war that disrupted energy and food supplies.\n",
            "But we‚Äôre better positioned than any country on Earth.\n",
            "We have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down.\n",
            "Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak.\n",
            "Food inflation is coming down.\n",
            "Inflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone up.\n",
            "Additionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start a new small business.\n",
            "Every time somebody starts a small business, it‚Äôs an act of hope.\n",
            "And the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enacted.\n",
            "Standing here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibility.\n",
            "Semiconductors, the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphones to automobiles, and so much more. These chips were invented right here in America.\n",
            "America used to make nearly 40% of the world‚Äôs chips.\n",
            "But in the last few decades, we lost our edge and we‚Äôre down to producing only 10%. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories overseas shut down.\n",
            "Today‚Äôs automobiles need up to 3,000 chips each, but American automakers couldn‚Äôt make enough cars because there weren‚Äôt enough chips.\n",
            "Car prices went up. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones.\n",
            "We can never let that happen again.\n",
            "That‚Äôs why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.\n",
            "We‚Äôre making sure the supply chain for America begins in America.\n",
            "We‚Äôve already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs even without this law.\n",
            "With this new law, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country.\n",
            "That‚Äôs going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two years.\n",
            "Outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres ‚Äì a literal field of dreams.\n",
            "That‚Äôll create 10,000 jobs. 7,000 construction jobs. 3,000 jobs once the factories are finished.\n",
            "Jobs paying $130,000 a year, and many don‚Äôt require a college degree.\n",
            "Jobs where people don‚Äôt have to leave home in search of opportunity.\n",
            "And it‚Äôs just getting started.\n",
            "Think about the new homes, new small businesses, and so much more that will come to life.\n",
            "Talk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they‚Äôll tell you what this means to their communities.\n",
            "We‚Äôre seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartland.\n",
            "But to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we also need the best infrastructure in the world.\n",
            "We used to be #1 in the world in infrastructure, then we fell to #13th.\n",
            "Now we‚Äôre coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower‚Äôs Interstate Highway System.\n",
            "Already, we‚Äôve funded over 20,000 projects, including at major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland.\n",
            "These projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, ports and airports, clean water, and high-speed internet across America.\n",
            "Urban. Suburban. Rural. Tribal.\n",
            "And we‚Äôre just getting started. I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the law.\n",
            "And to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don‚Äôt worry.\n",
            "I promised to be the president for all Americans.\n",
            "We‚Äôll fund your projects. And I‚Äôll see you at the ground-breaking.\n",
            "This law will help further unite all of America.\n",
            "Major projects like the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio over the Ohio River. Built 60 years ago. Badly in need of repairs.\n",
            "One of the nation‚Äôs most congested freight routes carrying $2 billion worth of freight every day. Folks have been talking about fixing it for decades, but we‚Äôre finally going to get it done.\n",
            "I went there last month with Democrats and Republicans from both states to deliver $1.6 billion for this project.\n",
            "While I was there, I met an ironworker named Sara, who is here tonight.\n",
            "For 30 years, she‚Äôs been a proud member of Ironworkers Local 44, known as the ‚Äúcowboys of the sky‚Äù who built the Cincinnati skyline.\n",
            "Sara said she can‚Äôt wait to be ten stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge. That‚Äôs pride.\n",
            "That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre also building ‚Äì Pride.\n",
            "We‚Äôre also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers, so every child in America can drink clean water.\n",
            "We‚Äôre making sure that every community has access to affordable, high-speed internet.\n",
            "No parent should have to drive to a McDonald‚Äôs parking lot so their kid can do their homework online.\n",
            "And when we do these projects, we‚Äôre going to Buy American.\n",
            "Buy American has been the law of the land since 1933. But for too long, past administrations have found ways to get around it.\n",
            "Not anymore.\n",
            "Tonight, I‚Äôm also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.\n",
            "American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables.\n",
            "And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.\n",
            "My economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they‚Äôre invisible.\n",
            "Maybe that‚Äôs you, watching at home.\n",
            "You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.\n",
            "I get it.\n",
            "That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre building an economy where no one is left behind.\n",
            "Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.\n",
            "For example, too many of you lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering what will happen if your spouse gets cancer, your child gets sick, or if something happens to you.\n",
            "Will you have the money to pay your medical bills? Will you have to sell the house?\n",
            "I get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we‚Äôre taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at night.\n",
            "You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on Earth.\n",
            "For example, one in ten Americans has diabetes.\n",
            "Every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive. Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make.\n",
            "But, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars ‚Äì and making record profits.\n",
            "Not anymore.\n",
            "We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare.\n",
            "But there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives.\n",
            "Let‚Äôs finish the job this time.\n",
            "Let‚Äôs cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it.\n",
            "This law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year when there are in fact many drugs, like expensive cancer drugs, that can cost up to $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000 a year.\n",
            "If drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies will have to pay Medicare back the difference.\n",
            "And we‚Äôre finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn‚Äôt just save seniors money.\n",
            "It will cut the federal deficit, saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars on the prescription drugs the government buys for Medicare.\n",
            "Why wouldn‚Äôt we want to do that?\n",
            "Now, some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\n",
            "Make no mistake, if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it.\n",
            "I‚Äôm pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever in history.\n",
            "A record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act.\n",
            "Thanks to the law I signed last year, millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums.\n",
            "But the way that law was written, that benefit expires after 2025.\n",
            "Let‚Äôs finish the job, make those savings permanent, and expand coverage to those left off Medicaid.\n",
            "Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisis.\n",
            "Lowering utility bills, creating American jobs, and leading the world to a clean energy future.\n",
            "I‚Äôve visited the devastating aftermaths of record floods and droughts, storms and wildfires.\n",
            "In addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we are rebuilding for the long term.\n",
            "New electric grids able to weather the next major storm.\n",
            "Roads and water systems to withstand the next big flood.\n",
            "Clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities too often left behind.\n",
            "We‚Äôre building 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers.\n",
            "And helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.\n",
            "Historic conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our lands.\n",
            "Let‚Äôs face reality.\n",
            "The climate crisis doesn‚Äôt care if your state is red or blue. It is an existential threat.\n",
            "We have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to confront it. I‚Äôm proud of how America is at last stepping up to the challenge.\n",
            "But there‚Äôs so much more to do.\n",
            "We will finish the job.\n",
            "And we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share.\n",
            "I‚Äôm a capitalist. But just pay your fair share.\n",
            "And I think a lot of you at home agree with me that our present tax system is simply unfair.\n",
            "The idea that in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes?\n",
            "That‚Äôs simply not fair.\n",
            "But now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15%.\n",
            "Just 15%.\n",
            "That‚Äôs less than a nurse pays. Let me be clear.\n",
            "Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxes.\n",
            "Nobody. Not one penny.\n",
            "But there‚Äôs more to do.\n",
            "Let‚Äôs finish the job. Reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for a billionaire minimum tax.\n",
            "Because no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.\n",
            "You may have noticed that Big Oil just reported record profits.\n",
            "Last year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis.\n",
            "It‚Äôs outrageous.\n",
            "They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down.\n",
            "Instead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.\n",
            "Corporations ought to do the right thing.\n",
            "That‚Äôs why I propose that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage long term investments instead.\n",
            "They will still make a considerable profit.\n",
            "Let‚Äôs finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes.\n",
            "Instead of cutting the number of audits of wealthy tax payers, I signed a law that will reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats.\n",
            "That‚Äôs being fiscally responsible.\n",
            "In the last two years, my administration cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion ‚Äì the largest deficit reduction in American history.\n",
            "Under the previous administration, America‚Äôs deficit went up four years in a row.\n",
            "Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor.\n",
            "Nearly 25% of the entire national debt, a debt that took 200 years to accumulate, was added by that administration alone.\n",
            "How did Congress respond to all that debt?\n",
            "They lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis.\n",
            "They paid America‚Äôs bills to prevent economic disaster for our country.\n",

            "Let us commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned.\n",
            "Some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what their plans are.\n",
            "Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years.\n",
            "That means if Congress doesn‚Äôt vote to keep them, those programs will go away.\n",
            "Other Republicans say if we don‚Äôt cut Social Security and Medicare, they‚Äôll let America default on its debt for the first time in our history.\n",

            "Americans have been paying into them with every single paycheck since they started working.\n",
            "So tonight, let‚Äôs all agree to stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security. We will not cut Medicare.\n",
            "Those benefits belong to the American people. They earned them.\n",
            "If anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.\n",

            "My plan will lower the deficit by $2 trillion.\n",
            "I won‚Äôt cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefit.\n",
            "In fact, I will extend the Medicare Trust Fund by at least two decades.\n",
            "I will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. And I will pay for the ideas I‚Äôve talked about tonight by making the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share.\n",
            "Look, here‚Äôs the deal. Big corporations aren‚Äôt just taking advantage of the tax code. They‚Äôre taking advantage of you, the American consumer.\n",
            "Here‚Äôs my message to all of you out there: I have your back. We‚Äôre already preventing insurance companies from sending surprise medical bills, stopping 1 million surprise bills a month.\n",
            "We‚Äôre protecting seniors‚Äô lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don‚Äôt need.\n",

            "Not anymore.\n",
            "We‚Äôre beginning to restore the dignity of work.\n",
            "For example, 30 million workers had to sign non-compete agreements when they took a job. So a cashier at a burger place can‚Äôt cross the street to take the same job at another burger place to make a couple bucks more.\n",
            "Not anymore.\n",
            "We‚Äôre banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they‚Äôre worth.\n",
            "I‚Äôm so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing.\n",
            "Pass the PRO Act because workers have a right to form a union. And let‚Äôs guarantee all workers a living wage.\n",

            "Let‚Äôs also restore the full Child Tax Credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.\n",
            "And by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity. We increase economic growth.\n",
            "Let‚Äôs also finish the job and get more families access to affordable and quality housing.\n",
            "Let‚Äôs get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. And give a little more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones.\n",
            "Pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care services they need and support the workers who are doing God‚Äôs work.\n",
            "These plans are fully paid for and we can afford to do them.\n",
            "Restoring the dignity of work also means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class.\n",
            "When we made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.\n",
            "But the world has caught up.\n",

            "And we‚Äôre making progress by reducing student debt and increasing Pell Grants for working- and middle-class families.\n",
            "Let‚Äôs finish the job, connect students to career opportunities starting in high school and provide two years of community college, some of the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a four-year degree.\n",

            "And folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis when schools were closed, let‚Äôs also recognize how far we‚Äôve come in the fight against the pandemic itself.\n",

            "Before I came to office many inspector generals who protect taxpayer dollars were sidelined. Fraud was rampant.\n",
            "Last year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then, we‚Äôve recovered billions of taxpayer dollars.\n",
            "Now, let‚Äôs triple our anti-fraud strike forces going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars from the American people.\n",
            "For every dollar we put into fighting fraud, taxpayers get back at least ten times as much.\n",
            "COVID left other scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.\n",
            "We have an obligation to make sure all our people are safe.\n",
            "Public safety depends on public trust. But too often that trust is violated.\n",
            "Joining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols, who had to bury him just last week. There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a child.\n",

            "With faith in God, she said her son ‚Äúwas a beautiful soul and something good will come from this.‚Äù\n",

            "We have to do better.\n",
            "Give law enforcement the training they need, hold them to higher standards, and help them succeed in keeping everyone safe.\n",
            "We also need more first responders and other professionals to address growing mental health and substance abuse challenges.\n",

            "That includes things that the majority of responsible gun owners support, like enhanced background checks for 18 to 21-year-olds and red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others.\n",

            "Two weeks ago, during Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio‚Äôs front door close and saw a man pointing a gun at him.\n",
            "He thought he was going to die, but then he thought about the people inside.\n",
            "In that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance studio.\n",
            "He saved lives. It‚Äôs time we do the same as well.\n",
            "Ban assault weapons once and for all.\n",
            "We did it before. I led the fight to ban them in 1994.\n",
            "In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled.\n",
            "Let‚Äôs finish the job and ban assault weapons again.\n",

            "We now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.\n",
            "Since we launched our new border plan last month, unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%.\n",
            "But America‚Äôs border problems won‚Äôt be fixed until Congress acts.\n",
            "If you won‚Äôt pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.\n",
            "Here in the people‚Äôs House, it‚Äôs our duty to protect all the people‚Äôs rights and freedoms.\n",

            "Would we stand for the right of people to live free from tyranny?\n",
            "Would we stand for the defense of democracy?\n",
            "For such a defense matters to us because it keeps the peace and prevents open season for would-be aggressors to threaten our security and prosperity. One year later, we know the answer.\n",
            "Yes, we would.\n",
            "And yes, we did.\n",

            "Ambassador, America is united in our support for your country. We will stand with you as long as it takes.\n",
            "Our nation is working for more freedom, more dignity, and more peace,not just in Europe, but everywhere.\n",
            "Before I came to office, the story was about how the People‚Äôs Republic of China was increasing its power and America was falling in the world.\n",

            "I‚Äôve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict.\n",
            "I will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, and that China‚Äôs government is intent on dominating.\n",

            "Today, we‚Äôre in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world.\n",
            "I am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world.\n",
            "But make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China‚Äôs threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.\n",
            "And let‚Äôs be clear: winning the competition with China should unite all of us. We face serious challenges across the world.\n",
            "But in the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker.\n",
            "Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.\n",
            "America is rallying the world again to meet those challenges, from climate and global health, to food insecurity, to terrorism and territorial aggression.\n",
            "Allies are stepping up, spending more and doing more.\n",
            "And bridges are forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic. And those who bet against America are learning just how wrong they are.\n",
            "It‚Äôs never a good bet to bet against America.\n",
            "When I came to office, most everyone assumed bipartisanship was impossible. But I never believed it.\n",

            "We‚Äôve made real progress.\n",
            "Together, we passed a law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction.\n",
            "Passed a gun safety law making historic investments in mental health.\n",
            "Launched ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in the fight against cancer,Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, and so much more.\n",
            "We passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named for the late Iraq war veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year.\n",
            "But there is so much more to do. And we can do it together.\n",
            "Joining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire.\n",
            "He wrote Jill and me a letter about his daughter Courtney. Contagious laugh. Her sister‚Äôs best friend.\n",
            "He shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans.\n",
            "Courtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually her death from a fentanyl overdose.\n",
            "She was 20 years old.\n",
            "Describing the last eight years without her, Doug said, ‚ÄúThere is no worse pain.‚Äù\n",
            "Yet their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end stigma and change laws.\n",
            "He told us he wants to ‚Äústart the journey towards America‚Äôs recovery.‚Äù\n",
            "Doug, we‚Äôre with you.\n",
            "Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.\n",
            "Let‚Äôs launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production, sale, and trafficking, with more drug detection machines to inspect cargo and stop pills and powder at the border.\n",
            "Working with couriers like Fed Ex to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.\n",
            "Second, let‚Äôs do more on mental health, especially for our children. When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at school.\n",
            "We must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit.\n",
            "And it‚Äôs time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us.\n",
            "Third, let‚Äôs do more to keep our nation‚Äôs one truly sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm‚Äôs way and care for them and their families when they come home.\n",
            "Job training and job placement for veterans and their spouses as they return to civilian life.\n",
            "Helping veterans afford their rent because no one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it.\n",
            "And we cannot go on losing 17 veterans a day to the silent scourge of suicide.\n",
            "The VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screenings and a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they‚Äôre going through and get the help they need.\n",
            "And fourth, last year Jill and I re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead in our Administration.\n",
            "Our goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years. Turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases. And provide more support for patients and families.\n",
            "It‚Äôs personal for so many of us.\n",
            "Joining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama.\n",
            "They met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I did.\n",
            "Kindred spirits.\n",
            "He wrote us a letter about their little daughter Ava.\n",
            "She was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney cancer.\n",
            "26 blood transfusions. 11 rounds of radiation. 8 rounds of chemo. 1 kidney removed.\n",
            "A 5% survival rate.\n",
            "He wrote how in the darkest moments he thought, ‚Äúif she goes, I can‚Äôt stay.‚Äù\n",
            "Jill and I understand, like so many of you.\n",
            "They read how Jill described our family‚Äôs cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where you can.\n",
            "For them, that glimmer of joy was a half-smile from their baby girl. It meant everything.\n",
            "They never gave up hope.\n",
            "Ava never gave up hope. She turns four next month.\n",
            "They just found out that Ava beat the odds and is on her way to being cancer free, and she‚Äôs watching from the White House tonight.\n",
            "For the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can do big things.\n",
            "Twenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It‚Äôs been a huge success.\n",
            "I believe we can do the same with cancer.\n",
            "Let‚Äôs end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all.\n",
            "There‚Äôs one reason why we‚Äôre able to do all of these things: our democracy itself.\n",
            "It‚Äôs the most fundamental thing of all.\n",
            "With democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is.\n",
            "For the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk.\n",
            "Put to the test here, in this very room, on January 6th.\n",
            "And then, just a few months ago, unhinged by the Big Lie, an assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the then-Speaker of this House of Representatives. Using the very same language that insurrectionists who stalked these halls chanted on January 6th.\n",
            "Here tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get.\n",
            "My friend, Paul Pelosi.\n",
            "But such a heinous act never should have happened.\n",
            "We must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America. In America, we must protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental right. We honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy.\n",
            "And we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.\n",
            "Democracy must not be a partisan issue. It must be an American issue.\n",
            "Every generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been called on to protect our democracy, to defend it, to stand up for it.\n",
            "And this is our moment.\n",
            "My fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the decisions we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to come.\n",
            "We are not bystanders to history. We are not powerless before the forces that confront us. It is within our power, of We the People. We are facing the test of our time and the time for choosing is at hand.\n",
            "We must be the nation we have always been at our best. Optimistic. Hopeful. Forward-looking.\n",
            "A nation that embraces, light over darkness, hope over fear, unity over division. Stability over chaos.\n",
            "We must see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We are a good people, the only nation in the world built on an idea.\n",
            "That all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities.\n",
            "So I have come here to fulfil my constitutional duty to report on the state of the union. And here is my report.\n",
            "Because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong.\n",
            "As I stand here tonight, I have never been more optimistic about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are.\n",
            "We are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothingbeyond our capacity if we do it together.\n",
